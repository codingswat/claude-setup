# guard-lib.sh — NOT a hook. Shared text handling for the four PreToolUse Bash guards
# (block-dangerous-git.sh, commit-pathspec-guard.sh, heavy-suite-guard.sh, gate-guard.sh),
# kept in one place so a normalisation fix lands in all four at once instead of drifting
# between four copies.
# What a guard reads is a SHELL command line, and the same command can be written many
# ways: quoted (`git reset "--hard"`), tab-separated, backslash-escaped (`gi\t`), split
# over lines with a trailing backslash, or hidden inside `sh -c "…"` / `eval "…"`. Every
# helper below exists to make those spellings match the one the pattern is written for.
#   strip_heredocs / strip_messages — drop pasted text and -m/--message arguments, so a
#     commit message that merely NAMES a banned command neither triggers nor disarms.
#   unwrap        — bring the command inside `bash|sh|zsh -c "…"` and `eval "…"` out to
#                   the top level, so a wrapper is not a bypass.
#   normalize_ws  — CR, tabs, escaped newlines and stray backslashes become plain spaces.
#   strip_quotechars — drop the quote CHARACTERS, keep the words (matching copy).
#   blank_quoted  — drop the quoted CONTENT (override copy: a word inside a string can
#                   never count as an override the user typed).
#   override_at_start — an override word counts only as a leading environment assignment.
#   has_substituted_git — `$(which git) commit` / `` `echo git` commit``: the binary is
#                   produced by substitution, so no pattern can see the word `git`.
# A guard that cannot find this file REFUSES the command (fail closed) — never carries on
# with un-normalised text, which would silently reopen every bypass above.
# Tests: hooks/test-hooks.sh (section 28).

# Python helper definitions, prepended to each guard's own python snippet:
#   python3 -c "$GUARD_PY_COMMON"'<the guard-specific code>'
